# Customer_churn-ML-

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for many companies, and being able to predict which customers are at risk of leaving can provide valuable insights for retention strategies. In this project, we use a dataset from a telecommunications company to build and evaluate predictive models for customer churn.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains various attributes related to customer demographics, account information, and service usage. The dataset is included in this repository as `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`.

## Project Structure

- `Telco Customer Churn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire analysis, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`: The dataset used for this project.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**:
    - Examined the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
    - Handled missing values and performed data cleaning.
    - Transformed categorical variables into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Created new features to capture additional information from the existing data.
    - Analyzed feature importance to select the most relevant features for the models.

3. **Modeling**:
    - Implemented several machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
    - Used cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

4. **Evaluation**:
    - Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Compared the performance of different models to select the best one.

## Results

The final model showed promising results in predicting customer churn, with a good balance between precision and recall. The insights gained from this analysis can help the company design effective retention strategies.

## Conclusion

Predicting customer churn can significantly benefit companies by allowing them to focus on retaining valuable customers. This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building a churn prediction model, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
